Particulate media code.

This is a prototype of a vectorized and task based discrete element software, implemented using ISPC and C++.
This code is at an early stage of development and it is not functional yet. Nonetheless,
it can be used as it is now, as a blueprint of a DEM code implemented predominately in [ISPC] (http://ispc.github.io).
