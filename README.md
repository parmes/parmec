# parmec
Particulate media code.

Parmec is a prototype of a vectorized and task based discrete element software, implemented using
[ISPC](http://ispc.github.io) and C++. This code is at an early stage of development and it is
only partially functional (see [documentation](http://parmes.org/parmec)). Parmec
can be used as a blueprint of a [DEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_element_method) code
implemented predominately in [ISPC](http://ispc.github.io).
